# Vehicle_detection
Real-Time Traffic and Air Quality Analysis System
This project implements a real-time traffic analysis system using OpenCV to detect, classify, and count vehicles—cars, trucks, and two-wheelers—from live video feeds. It also estimates each vehicle type's contribution to local Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, providing valuable environmental insights.

The system aims to support tech companies in making data-driven decisions about flexible work-from-home (WFH) policies during peak traffic and pollution days, helping reduce congestion and emissions. It also assists government agencies in tracking pollution trends and encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles for cleaner urban areas.

By analyzing daily and monthly traffic data, this solution offers a scalable and practical approach to urban sustainability, promoting smarter city planning and environmental responsibility.
